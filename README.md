Our e-commerce website is designed to offer a seamless shopping experienceâ€”from browsing products by categories to placing orders. At the core of this process lies a robust Inventory Management System (IMS) that activates at the final stage of the customer journey: the Thank You page. After a successful purchase, the system automatically navigates to the IMS, where it displays detailed information about the ordered product(s) directly on the browser window.
